Git: Git is a Version Control System (VCS) used to track a computer file on which it is working. It is used for source code management in Software Development. It allows many people to work together with other developers.

Steps to setup Git on your computer:
Step 1: Install Git on your computer.
Step 2: Make a repository on your computer with name as "hello-git".
Step 3: To associate the "hello-git" repository to your Git, you need to run commands on the command-line terminal.
The commands are:
	1. cd: used to move into the directory through command-line.
	2. cd ..: used to move out of a directory.
	3. git init: used to initialize the repository through git.
Step 4: create a text file as "git-commands" in the repository.
Step 5: run more git commands:
	1. git status: used to know what is going on in the repository.
	  (For the above command, we get that the file is untracked by the git, so we use another command)
	2. git add git-commands: it used to track the file of the repository.
	3. git commit -m "git-commands": it is used to commit the commands.

GitHub: It is a web based Git repository and helps to put our folder on the cloud based storage.
To add the repository on the GitHub, 
	1. you need to sign up on the GitHub account.
	2. click plus sign (+) in the top to add the repository.
After creating a repository, run the following commands:
	1. git remote add origin "your remote repo address here": used to git the repository file on the GitHub.
	2.git push -u origin master: used to push the file on GitHub
Now you are ready with the repository!
